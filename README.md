# linear_system_solver
Solves the linear system Ax=0 giving solution as column space of a matrix.

The input is given as coefficient matrix, A and then the solution for x is given as column space of the matrix.  The coefficient matrix, A, is converted into reduced row echelon form and then found the solution in the form of column space of the matrix.
